abstract: Social networking forms an important part of online activities of Web users.
  Web sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Orkut have millions of users using them
  everyday. However, these sites present two problems. Firstly, these sites form information
  silos. Information on one site is not usable in the others. Secondly such sites
  do not allow users much control over how their personal information is disseminated,
  which results in potential privacy problems. This paper presents how these problems
  can be solved by adopting a decentralized approach to online social networking.
  With this approach, users do not have to be bounded by a particular social networking
  service. This can provide the same or even higher level of user interaction as with
  many of the popular social networking sites we have today. In addition, it also
  allows users to have more control over their own data. A decentralized social networking
  framework described is based on open, technologies such as Linked Data [Berners-Lee
  2006], Semantic Web ontologies, open single-signon identity systems, and access
  control. The use of URIs as identifiers throughout allows the decentralized framework
  to be distributed and extensible, as users, applications and data to be linked to
  by referring to their URIs.
