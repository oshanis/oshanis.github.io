abstract: Despite recent advances in digital health solutions and machine learning,
  personal health applications that aim to modify health behaviors are still limited
  in their ability to offer more personalized decision support. Moreover, while many
  personal health applications cater to general health and well-being, there remains
  a significant opportunity to increase the clinical relevance of the insights being
  generated. This chapter describes the motivation for, and illustrative applications
  of, semantic technologies for enabling clinically relevant personal health applications.
  We present two use cases that demonstrate how semantic web technologies, in combination
  with machine learning and data mining methods, can be used to provide personalized
  insights to support behaviors that are consistent with nutritional guidelines for
  people with diabetes.
