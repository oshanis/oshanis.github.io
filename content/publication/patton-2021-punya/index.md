abstract: 'Modern smartphones offer advanced sensing, connectivity, and processing
  capabilities for data acquisition, processing, and generation: but it can be difficult
  and costly to develop mobile research apps that leverage these features. Nevertheless,
  in life sciences and other scientific domains, there often exists a need to develop
  advanced mobile apps that go beyond simple questionnaires: ranging from sensor data
  collection and processing to self-management tools for chronic patients in healthcare.
  We present Punya, an open source, web-based platform based on MIT App Inventor that
  simplifies building Linked Data-enabled, advanced mobile apps that exploit smartphone
  capabilities. We posit that its integration with Linked Data facilitates the development
  of complex application and business rules, communication with heterogeneous online
  services, and interaction with the Internet of Things (IoT) data sources using the
  smartphone hardware. To that end, Punya includes an embedded semantic rule engine,
  integration with GraphQL and SPARQL to access remote graph data, and support for
  IoT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and Linked Data Platform Constrained Application
  Protocol (LDP-CoAP). Moreover, Punya supports generating Linked Data descriptions
  of collected data. The platform includes built-in tutorials to quickly build apps
  using these different technologies. In this paper, we present a short discussion
  of the Punya platform, its current adoption that includes over 500 active users
  as well as the larger app-building MIT App Inventor community of which it is a part,
  and future development directions that would greatly benefit Semantic Web and Linked
  Data application developers as well as researchers who leverage Linked Open Data
  resources for their research.'
