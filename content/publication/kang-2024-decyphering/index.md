abstract: Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving space, with a continuous influx of new projects
  every year. However, an increasing number of incidents in the space, such as hacks
  and security breaches, threaten the growth of the community and the development
  of technology. This dynamic and often tumultuous landscape is vividly mirrored and
  shaped by discussions within “Crypto Twitter,” a key digital arena where investors,
  enthusiasts, and skeptics converge, revealing real-time sentiments and trends through
  social media interactions. We present our analysis on a Twitter dataset collected
  during a formative period of the cryptocurrency landscape. We collected 40 million
  tweets using keywords related to cryptocurrency and performed a nuanced analysis
  that involved grouping the tweets by semantic similarity and constructing a tweet
  and user network. We used sentence-level embeddings and autoencoders to create K-means
  clusters of tweets. We identified six groups of tweets and their topics to examine
  different cryptocurrency-related interests and the change in sentiment over time.
  For example, we identified different groups of tweets demonstrating coordinated
  behavior in the market or expressing distrust in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.
  Moreover, we discovered sentiment indicators that point to real-life incidents in
  the crypto world, such as the FTX incident of November 2022. We also constructed
  and analyzed different networks of tweets and users in our dataset by considering
  the reply and quote relationships and analyzed the largest components of each network.
  Our networks reveal a structure of bot activity in Crypto Twitter and suggest that
  they can be detected and handled using a network-based approach. Our work sheds
  light on the potential of social media signals to detect and understand crypto events,
  benefiting investors, regulators, and curious observers alike, as well as the potential
  for bot detection in Crypto Twitter using a network-based approach.
