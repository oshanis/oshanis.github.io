abstract: The Semantic Web community takes pride in developing technologies to make
  data significantly more valuable, interpretable, and computationally friendly by
  annotating the data appropriately with community-accepted vocabularies. For example,
  the core semantic web technology, the resource description framework, is designed
  to describe resources in a machine-readable way, and standardized ontologies, such
  as the recommended standard for capturing provenance on the web--PROV, were designed
  to provide lineage of data. This position paper argues that such semantic technologies
  could improve the quality of the data used in machine learning models, increase
  their accuracy, and make them more transparent and interpretable. We further argue
  that \"a framework for excellence in data engineering\" as put forth by the Data-centric
  AI workshop proposal (https://eval.how/dcai2021), has existed since the early 2000s,
  but there is a need for the Machine Learning and Semantic Web communities to collaborate
  to realize its full potential.
