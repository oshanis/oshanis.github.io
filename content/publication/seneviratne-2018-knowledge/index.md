abstract: With the rapid advancements in cancer research, the information that is
  useful for characterizing disease, staging tumors, and creating treatment and survivorship
  plans has been changing at a pace that creates challenges when physicians try to
  remain current. One example involves increasing usage of biomarkers when characterizing
  the pathologic prognostic stage of a breast tumor. We present our semantic technology
  approach to support cancer characterization and demonstrate it in our end-to-end
  prototype system that collects the newest breast cancer staging criteria from authoritative
  oncology manuals to construct an ontology for breast cancer. Using a tool we developed
  that utilizes this ontology, physician-facing applications can be used to quickly
  stage a new patient to support identifying risks, treatment options, and monitoring
  plans based on authoritative and best practice guidelines. Physicians can also re-stage
  existing patients or patient populations, allowing them to find patients whose stage
  has changed in a given patient cohort. As new guidelines emerge, using our proposed
  mechanism, which is grounded by semantic technologies for ingesting new data from
  staging manuals, we have created an enriched cancer staging ontology that integrates
  relevant data from several sources with very little human intervention.
