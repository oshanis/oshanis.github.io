## Exciting News: Introduction to AI Course Kicks Off in Spring 2025!  

I will be teaching **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** this upcoming Spring 2025 semester. 

I am re-designing this course to provide students with a solid foundation in Artificial Intelligence principles and practices in the age of generative AI. Through a mix of theory and hands-on learning, students will explore topics such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, reasoning, and various real-world AI applications.
