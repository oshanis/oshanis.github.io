abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can issue smart, context-sensitive
  recommendations to help patients self-manage their illnesses, including medication
  regimens, dietary habits, physical activity, and avoiding flare-ups. Instead of
  merely positing an ``edict,'' the AI model can also explain why the recommendation
  was issued: why one should stay indoors (e.g., increased risk of flare-ups), why
  further calorie intake should be avoided (e.g., met the daily limit), or why the
  care provider should be contacted (e.g., prescription change). The goal of these
  explanations is to achieve understanding and persuasion effects, which, in turn,
  targets education and long-term behavior change. Symbolic AI models facilitate explanations
  as they are able to offer logical proofs of inferences (or recommendations) from
  which explanations can be generated. We implemented a modular framework called XAIN
  (eXplanations for AI in Notation3) to explain symbolic reasoning inferences in a
  trace-based, contrastive, and counterfactual way. We applied this framework to explain
  recommendations for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to avoid
  flare-ups. For evaluation, we propose a questionnaire that captures understanding,
  persuasion, education, and behavior change, together with traditional XAI metrics
  including fidelity (soundness, completeness) and interpretability (parsimony, clarity)."
