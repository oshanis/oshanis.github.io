The aims of this project are to develop:

1. An expressive, provenance-centric language, called SCIENCE Capability-based, Intention-centric, Experiment-oriented, Networked Collaborative Expression (SCIENCE) language will capture “science-capability” of the biomedical research datasets.
2. A methodology for smart contracts will encode data use agreements and shared governance of data to create computational data use agreements supporting the automatic evaluation of compliance.
3. Novel consensus mechanisms will enable reporting the impact of scientific data and the reproducibility of the research methods, thus providing incentives to scientists in supplying well-annotated, highly reusable data and reproducible research methods.
