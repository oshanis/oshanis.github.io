Currently, there are several ontologies related to food, but they are specialized in specific domains, e.g., from an agricultural, production, or specific health condition point-of-view. There is a lack of a unified knowledge graph that is oriented towards consumers who want to eat healthily, and who need an integrated food suggestion service that encompasses food and recipes that they encounter on a day-to-day basis, along with the provenance of the information they receive. Our resource contribution is a software toolkit that can be used to create a unified food knowledge graph that links the various silos related to food while preserving the provenance information. We describe the construction process of our knowledge graph, the plan for its maintenance, and how this knowledge graph has been utilized in several applications. These applications include a SPARQL-based service that lets a user determine what recipe to make based on ingredients at hand while taking constraints such as allergies into account, as well as a cognitive agent that can perform natural language question answering on the knowledge graph.Resource Website:}, booktitle = {The Semantic Web – ISWC 2019: 18th International Semantic Web Conference, Auckland, New Zealand, October 26–30, 2019, Proceedings, Part II}, pages = {146–162}, numpages = {17}, location = {Auckland, New Zealand}

abstract = {Social networking forms an important part of online activities of Web users. Web sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Orkut have millions of users using them everyday. However, these sites present two problems. Firstly, these sites form information silos. Information on one site is not usable in the others. Secondly such sites do not allow users much control over how their personal information is disseminated, which results in potential privacy problems.
This paper presents how these problems can be solved by adopting a decentralized approach to online social networking. With this approach, users do not have to be bounded by a particular social networking service. This can provide the same or even higher level of user interaction as with many of the popular social networking sites we have today. In addition, it also allows users to have more control over their own data. A decentralized social networking framework described is based on open, technologies such as Linked Data [Berners-Lee 2006], Semantic Web ontologies, open single-signon identity systems, and access control. The use of URIs as identifiers throughout allows the decentralized framework to be distributed and extensible, as users, applications and data to be linked to by referring to their URIs.}

  abstract={Online communities are changing the way we think about restricting or opening access to information. This is no more truer than in online mapping which is fueling community interest in collaborative applications. The open source communities are much like a commons of information where the non-subtractable resource actually grows with use. Restricting access to geospatial information will cut off the oxygen for both scientific as well as community activities that depend upon it. Information is restricted for many different reasons, but clearly, free and open access to new information is not guaranteed. The solution lies in not one but in multiple ap- proaches that satisfy public policy, scientific, community and economic interests. In this paper we propose an approach for using technology to aid public policy by enabling the user to do the right thing instead of preventing the user from doing the wrong thing.}

  abstract={The Semantic Web community takes pride in developing technologies to make data significantly more valuable, interpretable, and computationally friendly by annotating the data appropriately with community-accepted vocabularies. For example, the core semantic web technology, the resource description framework, is designed to describe resources in a machine-readable way, and standardized ontologies, such as the recommended standard for capturing provenance on the web--PROV, were designed to provide lineage of data. This position paper argues that such semantic technologies could improve the quality of the data used in machine learning models, increase their accuracy, and make them more transparent and interpretable. We further argue that "a framework for excellence in data engineering" as put forth by the Data-centric AI workshop proposal (https://eval.how/dcai2021), has existed since the early 2000s, but there is a need for the Machine Learning and Semantic Web communities to collaborate to realize its full potential.}

These applications will also have the capability of empowering citizens involved in crisis situations to contribute via crowdsourcing, and to communicate up-to-date information to others. We will leverage several technologies to develop this application framework, namely (i) Linked Data principles for structured data, (ii) existing data sources and ontologies for disaster management, and (iii) App Inventor, which is a mobile application development framework for non-programmers.

abstract="Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems since their conception, with the need for explainability growing as more complex AI models are increasingly used in critical, high-stakes settings such as healthcare. Explanations have often added to an AI system in a non-principled, post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specific explanation types and the system's AI capabilities. We design an explanation ontology to model both the role of explanations, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process, and the range of different literature-derived explanation types. We indicate how the ontology can support user requirements for explanations in the domain of healthcare. We evaluate our ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to decide which explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in system design settings and in real-time operations. Through the use of this ontology, system designers will be able to make informed choices on which explanations AI systems can and should provide.",

abstract = {Given the ubiquity of data on the web, and the lack of usage restriction enforcement mechanisms, stories of personal, creative and other kinds of data misuses are on the rise. There should be both sociological and technological mechanisms that facilitate accountability on the web that would prevent such data misuses. Sociological mechanisms appeal to the data consumer's self-interest in adhering to the data provider's desires. This involves a system of rewards such as recognition and financial incentives, and deterrents such as prohibitions by laws for any violations and social pressure. Bur there is no well-defined technological mechanism for the discovery of accountability or the lack of it on the web. As part of my PhD thesis I propose a solution to this problem by designing a web protocol called HTTPA (Accountable HTTP). This protocol will enable data consumers and data producers to agree to specific usage restrictions, preserve the provenance of data transferred from a web server to a client and back to another web server, and more importantly provide a mechanism to derive an `audit trail' for the data reuse with the help of a trusted intermediary called a `Provenance Tracker Network'.},

One example involves increasing usage of biomarkers when characterizing the pathologic prognostic stage of a breast tumor. We present our semantic technology approach to support cancer characterization and demonstrate it in our end-to-end prototype system that collects the newest breast cancer staging criteria from authoritative oncology manuals to construct an ontology for breast cancer. Using a tool we developed that utilizes this ontology, physician-facing applications can be used to quickly stage a new patient to support identifying risks, treatment options, and monitoring plans based on authoritative and best practice guidelines. Physicians can also re-stage existing patients or patient populations, allowing them to find patients whose stage has changed in a given patient cohort. As new guidelines emerge, using our proposed mechanism, which is grounded by semantic technologies for ingesting new data from staging manuals, we have created an enriched cancer staging ontology that integrates relevant data from several sources with very little human intervention.",

    ABSTRACT={<p>People can affect change in their eating patterns by substituting ingredients in recipes. Such substitutions may be motivated by specific goals, like modifying the intake of a specific nutrient or avoiding a particular category of ingredients. Determining how to modify a recipe can be difficult because people need to 1) identify which ingredients can act as valid replacements for the original and 2) figure out whether the substitution is “good” for their particular context, which may consider factors such as allergies, nutritional contents of individual ingredients, and other dietary restrictions. We propose an approach to leverage both explicit semantic information about ingredients, encapsulated in a knowledge graph of food, and implicit semantics, captured through word embeddings, to develop a substitutability heuristic to rank plausible substitute options automatically. Our proposed system also helps determine which ingredient substitution options are “healthy” using nutritional information and food classification constraints. We evaluate our substitutability heuristic, diet-improvement ingredient substitutability heuristic (DIISH), using a dataset of ground-truth substitutions scraped from ingredient substitution guides and user reviews of recipes, demonstrating that our approach can help reduce the human effort required to make recipes more suitable for specific dietary needs.</p>}}

abstract="Treatment recommendations within Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are largely based on findings from clinical trials and case studies, referred to here as research studies, that are often based on highly selective clinical populations, referred to here as study cohorts. When medical practitioners apply CPG recommendations, they need to understand how well their patient population matches the characteristics of those in the study cohort, and thus are confronted with the challenges of locating the study cohort information and making an analytic comparison. To address these challenges, we develop an ontology-enabled prototype system, which exposes the population descriptions in research studies in a declarative manner, with the ultimate goal of allowing medical practitioners to better understand the applicability and generalizability of treatment recommendations. We build a Study Cohort Ontology (SCO) to encode the vocabulary of study population descriptions, that are often reported in the first table in the published work, thus they are often referred to as Table 1. We leverage the well-used Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) for defining property associations between classes. Further, we model the key components of Table 1s, i.e., collections of study subjects, subject characteristics, and statistical measures in RDF knowledge graphs. We design scenarios for medical practitioners to perform population analysis, and generate cohort similarity visualizations to determine the applicability of a study population to the clinical population of interest. Our semantic approach to make study populations visible, by standardized representations of Table 1s, allows users to quickly derive clinically relevant inferences about study populations.",

abstract="Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can issue smart, context-sensitive recommendations to help patients self-manage their illnesses, including medication regimens, dietary habits, physical activity, and avoiding flare-ups. Instead of merely positing an ``edict,'' the AI model can also explain why the recommendation was issued: why one should stay indoors (e.g., increased risk of flare-ups), why further calorie intake should be avoided (e.g., met the daily limit), or why the care provider should be contacted (e.g., prescription change). The goal of these explanations is to achieve understanding and persuasion effects, which, in turn, targets education and long-term behavior change. Symbolic AI models facilitate explanations as they are able to offer logical proofs of inferences (or recommendations) from which explanations can be generated. We implemented a modular framework called XAIN (eXplanations for AI in Notation3) to explain symbolic reasoning inferences in a trace-based, contrastive, and counterfactual way. We applied this framework to explain recommendations for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to avoid flare-ups. For evaluation, we propose a questionnaire that captures understanding, persuasion, education, and behavior change, together with traditional XAI metrics including fidelity (soundness, completeness) and interpretability (parsimony, clarity).",

abstract="Modern smartphones offer advanced sensing, connectivity, and processing capabilities for data acquisition, processing, and generation: but it can be difficult and costly to develop mobile research apps that leverage these features. Nevertheless, in life sciences and other scientific domains, there often exists a need to develop advanced mobile apps that go beyond simple questionnaires: ranging from sensor data collection and processing to self-management tools for chronic patients in healthcare. We present Punya, an open source, web-based platform based on MIT App Inventor that simplifies building Linked Data-enabled, advanced mobile apps that exploit smartphone capabilities. We posit that its integration with Linked Data facilitates the development of complex application and business rules, communication with heterogeneous online services, and interaction with the Internet of Things (IoT) data sources using the smartphone hardware. To that end, Punya includes an embedded semantic rule engine, integration with GraphQL and SPARQL to access remote graph data, and support for IoT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and Linked Data Platform Constrained Application Protocol (LDP-CoAP). Moreover, Punya supports generating Linked Data descriptions of collected data. The platform includes built-in tutorials to quickly build apps using these different technologies. In this paper, we present a short discussion of the Punya platform, its current adoption that includes over 500 active users as well as the larger app-building MIT App Inventor community of which it is a part, and future development directions that would greatly benefit Semantic Web and Linked Data application developers as well as researchers who leverage Linked Open Data resources for their research.",

abstract="We propose a decentralized finance (DeFi) survival analysis approach for discovering and characterizing user behavior and risks in lending protocols. We demonstrate how to gather and prepare DeFi transaction data for survival analysis. We demonstrate our approach using transactions in AAVE, one of the largest lending protocols. We develop a DeFi survival analysis pipeline which first prepares transaction data for survival analysis through the selection of different index events (or transactions) and associated outcome events. Then we apply survival analysis statistical and visualization methods such as median survival times, Kaplan--Meier survival curves, and Cox hazard regression to gain insights into usage patterns and risks within the protocol. We show how by varying the index and outcome events, we can utilize DeFi survival analysis to answer three different questions. What do users do after a deposit? How long until borrows are first repaid or liquidated? How does coin type influence liquidation risk? The proposed DeFi survival analysis can easily be generalized to other DeFi lending protocols. By defining appropriate index and outcome events, DeFi survival analysis can be applied to any cryptocurrency protocol with transactions.",

abstract="The emerging decentralized financial ecosystem (DeFi) is comprised of numerous protocols, one type being lending protocols. People make transactions in lending protocols, each of which is attributed to a specific blockchain address which could represent an externally-owned account (EOA) or a smart contract. Using Aave, one of the largest lending protocols, we summarize the transactions made by each address in each quarter from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2022. We cluster these quarterly summaries to identify and name common patterns of quarterly behavior in Aave. We then use these clusters to glean insights into the dominant behaviors in Aave. We show that there are three kinds of keepers, i.e., a specific type of users tasked with the protocol's governance, but only one kind of keeper finds consistent success in making profits from liquidations. We identify the largest-scale accounts in Aave and the highest-risk kinds of behavior on the platform. Additionally, we use the temporal aspect of the clusters to track how common behaviors change through time and how usage has shifted in the wake of major events that impacted the crypto market, and we show that there seem to be problems with user retention in Aave as many of the addresses that perform transactions do not remain in the market for long.",

Therefore, there is an increasing need for a secure, scalable, and trustworthy data-sharing ecosystem that promotes and rewards collaborative data-sharing efforts among researchers, and a robust incentive mechanism is required to achieve this objective. Reputation-based incentives, such as the h-index, have historically played a pivotal role in the academic community. However, the h-index suffers from several limitations. This paper introduces the SCIENCE-index, a blockchain-based metric measuring a researcher’s scientific contributions. Utilizing the Microsoft Academic Graph and machine learning techniques, the SCIENCE-index predicts the progress made by a researcher over their career and provides a soft incentive for sharing their datasets with peer researchers. To incentivize researchers to share their data, the SCIENCE-index is augmented to include a data-sharing parameter. DataCite, a database of openly available datasets, proxies this parameter, which is further enhanced by including a researcher’s data-sharing activity. Our model is evaluated by comparing the distribution of its output for geographically diverse researchers to that of the h-index. We observe that it results in a much more even spread of evaluations. The SCIENCE-index is a crucial component in constructing a decentralized protocol that promotes trust-based data sharing, addressing the current inequity in dataset sharing. The work outlined in this paper provides the foundation for assessing scientific contributions in future data-sharing spaces powered by decentralized applications.}, booktitle = {Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023}, pages = {826–833}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {Incentive Mechanisms, Author-level Metrics, Dataset Sharing, Smart Contracts, Blockchain, Peer-to-peer Sharing}, location = {Austin, TX, USA}, series = {WWW '23 Companion} }

    abstract = {Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving space, with a continuous influx of new projects every year. However, an increasing number of incidents in the space, such as hacks and security breaches, threaten the growth of the community and the development of technology. This dynamic and often tumultuous landscape is vividly mirrored and shaped by discussions within “Crypto Twitter,” a key digital arena where investors, enthusiasts, and skeptics converge, revealing real-time sentiments and trends through social media interactions. We present our analysis on a Twitter dataset collected during a formative period of the cryptocurrency landscape. We collected 40 million tweets using keywords related to cryptocurrency and performed a nuanced analysis that involved grouping the tweets by semantic similarity and constructing a tweet and user network. We used sentence-level embeddings and autoencoders to create K-means clusters of tweets. We identified six groups of tweets and their topics to examine different cryptocurrency-related interests and the change in sentiment over time. For example, we identified different groups of tweets demonstrating coordinated behavior in the market or expressing distrust in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Moreover, we discovered sentiment indicators that point to real-life incidents in the crypto world, such as the FTX incident of November 2022. We also constructed and analyzed different networks of tweets and users in our dataset by considering the reply and quote relationships and analyzed the largest components of each network. Our networks reveal a structure of bot activity in Crypto Twitter and suggest that they can be detected and handled using a network-based approach. Our work sheds light on the potential of social media signals to detect and understand crypto events, benefiting investors, regulators, and curious observers alike, as well as the potential for bot detection in Crypto Twitter using a network-based approach.},

abstract="Personal health data can come from diverse sources and formats. The heterogeneity of these data sources and the multiple stakeholders involved requires robust, standards-compliant architectures that can adapt to rapidly changing data streams that may be enriched with new types of data from new data endpoints. This chapter surveys the existing state of the art in collecting and managing personal health data primarily available through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Various open-source solutions for generic personal data management require specific consideration if adopted to handle health data collected through IoMT. More specifically, for health data, there are burgeoning open-source initiatives that focus on novel machine learning techniques for personal health data on the ``edge.'' There are also various commercial solutions in this space, but they all operate in silos, which may need to change to achieve greater connectivity and interoperability. The chapter surveys existing solutions for personal health data management, discuss their strengths, and provides critical analyses of the aspects lacking in these systems. The chapter will conclude with future directions that would ultimately culminate in better IoMT integrated architectures for personal health data collection, storage, and management in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.",

abstract="Decentralized information-sharing mediums, such as the Web, have been designed to share information by merely creating a document on a web server and linking it from another document. As the Web has grown exponentially in its existence for over three decades, we have come to face many tough questions on the data and content shared on the Web. Some of these questions include how do we characterize data on the Web, who owns the data, how does ownership help decide anything? If we own data, how do we give consent for uncertain future analyses or activities? How can we use data for purposes beyond its intended use ethically and responsibly? Furthermore, what is the meaning of morally responsible data collection, usage, and sharing? As users can anonymously or pseudonymously engage in activities, the lack of an individual's identity on the Web is further complicated because consent on data usage changes in value, especially concerning confidentiality over time. While there are no simple answers to these challenging questions, there have been several technological advances to provide Web-based data provenance and accountability on the Web. This chapter reviews some of the underlying problems that give rise to data reuse and accountability issues on the Web, and features technical solutions with provenance by utilizing the Resource Description Framework (RDF).",

abstract = {Medical experts may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems with greater trust if these are supported by ‘contextual explanations’ that let the practitioner connect system inferences to their context of use. However, their importance in improving model usage and understanding has not been extensively studied. Hence, we consider a comorbidity risk prediction scenario and focus on contexts regarding the patients’ clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We explore how relevant information for such dimensions can be extracted from Medical guidelines to answer typical questions from clinical practitioners. We identify this as a question answering (QA) task and employ several state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to present contexts around risk prediction model inferences and evaluate their acceptability. Finally, we study the benefits of contextual explanations by building an end-to-end AI pipeline including data cohorting, AI risk modeling, post-hoc model explanations, and prototyped a visual dashboard to present the combined insights from different context dimensions and data sources, while predicting and identifying the drivers of risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - a common type-2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbidity. All of these steps were performed in deep engagement with medical experts, including a final evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show that LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract some relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the value-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these regarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting. Overall, our paper is one of the first end-to-end analyses identifying the feasibility and benefits of contextual explanations in a real-world clinical use case. Our findings can help improve clinicians’ usage of AI models.}

Moreover, while many personal health applications cater to general health and well-being, there remains a significant opportunity to increase the clinical relevance of the insights being generated. This chapter describes the motivation for, and illustrative applications of, semantic technologies for enabling clinically relevant personal health applications. We present two use cases that demonstrate how semantic web technologies, in combination with machine learning and data mining methods, can be used to provide personalized insights to support behaviors that are consistent with nutritional guidelines for people with diabetes.",

    abstract="We explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate application code that automates health insurance processes from text-based policies. We target blockchain-based smart contracts as they offer immutability, verifiability, scalability, and a trustless setting: any number of parties can use the smart contracts, and they need not have previously established trust relationships with each other. Our methodology generates outputs at increasing levels of technical detail: (1) textual summaries, (2) declarative decision logic, and (3) smart contract code with unit tests. We ascertain LLMs are good at task (1), and the structured output is useful to validate tasks (2) and (3). Declarative languages (task 2) are often used to formalize healthcare policies, but their execution on blockchain is non-trivial. Hence, task (3) attempts to directly automate the process using smart contracts. To assess the LLM output, we propose completeness, soundness, clarity, syntax, and functioning code as metrics. Our evaluation employs three health insurance policies (scenarios) with increasing difficulty from Medicare's official booklet. Our evaluation uses GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and CodeLLaMA. Our findings confirm that LLMs perform quite well in generating textual summaries. Although outputs from tasks (2)--(3) are useful starting points, they require human oversight: in multiple cases, even ``runnable'' code will not yield sound results, the popularity of the target language affects the output quality, and more complex scenarios still seem a bridge too far. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate the promise of LLMs for translating textual process descriptions into smart contracts.",

The smaller dataset can then be used to train a model which can perform comparably to a model trained on the full dataset. Past works have examined this approach for image datasets, focusing on neural networks as target models. However, tabular datasets pose new challenges not seen in images. A sample in tabular dataset is a one dimensional vector unlike the two (or three) dimensional pixel grid of images, and Non-NN models such as XGBoost can often outperform neural network (NN) based models. Our contribution in this work is two-fold: 1) We show in our work that data distillation methods from images do not translate directly to tabular data; 2) We propose a new distillation method that consistently outperforms the baseline for multiple different models, including non-NN models such as XGBoost.},

We apply local differential privacy to provide privacy for embeddings stored on a blockchain, hence protecting the original data. We provide the first prototype application of differential privacy with blockchain for vertical federated learning. Our experiments with medical data show that DP-BBVFL achieves high accuracy with a tradeoff in training time due to on-chain aggregation.

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology and its adoption across various sectors have raised critical discussions about the need for regulatory mechanisms to ensure consumer protection, maintain financial stability, and address privacy concerns without compromising the foundational principles of decentralization and immutability inherent in blockchain platforms. We examine the existing mechanisms for smart contract termination across several major blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, IOTA, Apotos, and Sui. We assess the compatibility of these mechanisms with the requirements of the EU Data Act, focusing on aspects such as consumer protection, error correction, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis reveals a diverse landscape of approaches, from immutable smart contracts with built-in termination conditions to upgradable smart contracts that allow for post-deployment modifications. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing the so-called smart contract “kill switches,” such as the balance between enabling regulatory compliance and preserving the decentralized ethos, the technical feasibility of such mechanisms, and the implications for security and trust in the ecosystem.}

Leveraging advanced language models, specifically GPT-4 and Llama 3, we aim to scrutinize and compare their abilities to generate coherent and effective code for Python, R, and SQL based on natural language prompts. We design an experiment to assess the performance of LLMs on natural language prompts on a large temporal financial dataset. We created a set of queries with hand-crafted R code answers. To investigate the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, each query was created with different factors that characterize the financial meaning of the queries and their complexity. We demonstrate how to create specific zero-shot prompts to generate code to answer natural language queries about temporal financial tabular data. We develop specific system prompts for each language to ensure they correctly answer time-oriented questions. We execute this experiment on two LLMs (GPT-4 and Llama 3), assess if the outputs produced are executable and correct, and assess the efficiency of the produced code for Python, SQL, and R. We find that while LLMs have promising performance, their performance varies greatly across the languages, models, and experimental factors. GPT-4 performs best on Python (95.2\% correctness) but has significantly weaker performance on SQL (87.6\% correctness) and R (79.0\% correctness). Llama 3 is less successful at generating code overall, but it achieves its best results in R (71.4\% correctness). A multi-factor statistical analysis of the results with respect to the defined experimental factors provides further insights into the specific areas of challenge in code generation for each LLM. Our preliminary results on this modest benchmark demonstrate a framework for developing larger, comprehensive, unique benchmarks for both temporal financial tabular data and R code generation. While Python and SQL already have benchmarks, we are filling in the gaps for R. Powerful AI agents for text-to-code generation, as demonstrated in this work, provide a critical capability required for the next-generation AI-based natural language financial intelligence systems and chatbots, directly addressing the complex challenges presented by querying temporal tabular financial data.},

  abstract="The proliferation of spam on the Web has necessitated the development of machine learning models to automate their detection. However, the dynamic nature of spam and the sophisticated evasion techniques employed by spammers often lead to low accuracy in these models. Traditional machine-learning approaches struggle to keep pace with spammers' constantly evolving tactics, resulting in a persistent challenge to maintain high detection rates. To address this, we propose blockchain-enabled incentivized crowdsourcing as a novel solution to enhance spam detection systems. We create an incentive mechanism for data collection and labeling by leveraging blockchain's decentralized and transparent framework. Contributors are rewarded for accurate labels and penalized for inaccuracies, ensuring high-quality data. A smart contract governs the submission and evaluation process, with participants staking cryptocurrency as collateral to guarantee integrity. Simulations show that incentivized crowdsourcing improves data quality, leading to more effective machine-learning models for spam detection. This approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution to the challenges of traditional methods.",
