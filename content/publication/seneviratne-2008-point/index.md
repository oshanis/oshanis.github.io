abstract: RDF is at the heart of the Semantic Web as it is the primary means by which
  applications can share data and interoper- ate. Tabulator is a generic data browser
  and editor for linked RDF data on the web. It was developed with the motiva- tion
  of providing a natural and a seamless experience for browsing and editing data (Tim
  Berners-Lee, 2008). This paper describes how Tabulator can be used to develop cus-
  tom applications which consume RDF data, in addition to providing a generic data
  browsing and editing environment. The goal is to make sure that the end-user has
  the ability to view the RDF data in a visualization that is most suitable given
  the nature of the data.
