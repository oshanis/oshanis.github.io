abstract: Smartphones are being used for a wide range of activities including messaging,
  social networking, calendar and contact management as well as location and context-aware
  applications. The ubiquity of handheld computing technology has been found to be
  especially useful in disaster management and relief operations. Our focus is to
  enable developers to quickly deploy applications that take advantage of key sources
  that are fundamental for today's networked citizens, including Twitter feeds, Facebook
  posts, current news releases, and government data. These applications will also
  have the capability of empowering citizens involved in crisis situations to contribute
  via crowdsourcing, and to communicate up-to-date information to others. We will
  leverage several technologies to develop this application framework, namely (i)
  Linked Data principles for structured data, (ii) existing data sources and ontologies
  for disaster management, and (iii) App Inventor, which is a mobile application development
  framework for non-programmers. In this paper, we describe our motivating use cases,
  our architecture, and our prototype implementation.
