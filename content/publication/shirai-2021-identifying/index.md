abstract: <p>People can affect change in their eating patterns by substituting ingredients
  in recipes. Such substitutions may be motivated by specific goals, like modifying
  the intake of a specific nutrient or avoiding a particular category of ingredients.
  Determining how to modify a recipe can be difficult because people need to 1) identify
  which ingredients can act as valid replacements for the original and 2) figure out
  whether the substitution is “good” for their particular context, which may consider
  factors such as allergies, nutritional contents of individual ingredients, and other
  dietary restrictions. We propose an approach to leverage both explicit semantic
  information about ingredients, encapsulated in a knowledge graph of food, and implicit
  semantics, captured through word embeddings, to develop a substitutability heuristic
  to rank plausible substitute options automatically. Our proposed system also helps
  determine which ingredient substitution options are “healthy” using nutritional
  information and food classification constraints. We evaluate our substitutability
  heuristic, diet-improvement ingredient substitutability heuristic (DIISH), using
  a dataset of ground-truth substitutions scraped from ingredient substitution guides
  and user reviews of recipes, demonstrating that our approach can help reduce the
  human effort required to make recipes more suitable for specific dietary needs.</p>
