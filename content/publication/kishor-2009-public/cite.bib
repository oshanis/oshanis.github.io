 abstract = {Online communities are changing the way we think about restricting or opening access to information. This is no more truer than in online mapping which is fueling community interest in collaborative applications. The open source communities are much like a commons of information where the non-subtractable resource actually grows with use. Restricting access to geospatial information will cut off the oxygen for both scientific as well as community activities that depend upon it. Information is restricted for many different reasons, but clearly, free and open access to new information is not guaranteed. The solution lies in not one but in multiple ap- proaches that satisfy public policy, scientific, community and economic interests. In this paper we propose an approach for using technology to aid public policy by enabling the user to do the right thing instead of preventing the user from doing the wrong thing.},
