abstract: Computational thinking is a fundamental skill that extends beyond computer
  science. Conceptually it involves logic, algorithms, patterns, abstraction, and
  evaluation. The approach for developing a computational mind-set may involve experimenting,
  creating, debugging, and collaborating. Due to certain implicit biases and societal
  and cultural factors, girls may not be exposed to these computational thinking concepts
  and approaches. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of women in computer
  science since the 1980s. This chapter summarizes some of the challenges faced when
  teaching introductory computer science to high school girls and the approaches taken
  to overcome those challenges.
