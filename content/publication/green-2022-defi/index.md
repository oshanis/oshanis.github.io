abstract: We propose a decentralized finance (DeFi) survival analysis approach for
  discovering and characterizing user behavior and risks in lending protocols. We
  demonstrate how to gather and prepare DeFi transaction data for survival analysis.
  We demonstrate our approach using transactions in AAVE, one of the largest lending
  protocols. We develop a DeFi survival analysis pipeline which first prepares transaction
  data for survival analysis through the selection of different index events (or transactions)
  and associated outcome events. Then we apply survival analysis statistical and visualization
  methods such as median survival times, Kaplan--Meier survival curves, and Cox hazard
  regression to gain insights into usage patterns and risks within the protocol. We
  show how by varying the index and outcome events, we can utilize DeFi survival analysis
  to answer three different questions. What do users do after a deposit? How long
  until borrows are first repaid or liquidated? How does coin type influence liquidation
  risk? The proposed DeFi survival analysis can easily be generalized to other DeFi
  lending protocols. By defining appropriate index and outcome events, DeFi survival
  analysis can be applied to any cryptocurrency protocol with transactions.
