abstract: In the present academic landscape, the process of collecting data is slow,
  and the lax infrastructures for data collaborations lead to significant delays in
  coming up with and disseminating conclusive findings. Therefore, there is an increasing
  need for a secure, scalable, and trustworthy data-sharing ecosystem that promotes
  and rewards collaborative data-sharing efforts among researchers, and a robust incentive
  mechanism is required to achieve this objective. Reputation-based incentives, such
  as the h-index, have historically played a pivotal role in the academic community.
  However, the h-index suffers from several limitations. This paper introduces the
  SCIENCE-index, a blockchain-based metric measuring a researcher’s scientific contributions.
  Utilizing the Microsoft Academic Graph and machine learning techniques, the SCIENCE-index
  predicts the progress made by a researcher over their career and provides a soft
  incentive for sharing their datasets with peer researchers. To incentivize researchers
  to share their data, the SCIENCE-index is augmented to include a data-sharing parameter.
  DataCite, a database of openly available datasets, proxies this parameter, which
  is further enhanced by including a researcher’s data-sharing activity. Our model
  is evaluated by comparing the distribution of its output for geographically diverse
  researchers to that of the h-index. We observe that it results in a much more even
  spread of evaluations. The SCIENCE-index is a crucial component in constructing
  a decentralized protocol that promotes trust-based data sharing, addressing the
  current inequity in dataset sharing. The work outlined in this paper provides the
  foundation for assessing scientific contributions in future data-sharing spaces
  powered by decentralized applications.
