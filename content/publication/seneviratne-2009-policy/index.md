abstract: The Web allows users to share their work very effectively leading to the
  rapid re-use and remixing of content on the Web including text, images, and videos.
  Scientific research data, social networks, blogs, photo sharing sites and other
  such applications known collectively as the Social Web have lots of increasingly
  complex information. Such information from several Web pages can be very easily
  aggregated, mashed up and presented in other Web pages. Content generation of this
  nature inevitably leads to many copyright and license violations, motivating research
  into effective methods to detect and prevent such violations.
