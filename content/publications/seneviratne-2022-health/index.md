abstract: Personal health data can come from diverse sources and formats. The heterogeneity
  of these data sources and the multiple stakeholders involved requires robust, standards-compliant
  architectures that can adapt to rapidly changing data streams that may be enriched
  with new types of data from new data endpoints. This chapter surveys the existing
  state of the art in collecting and managing personal health data primarily available
  through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Various open-source solutions
  for generic personal data management require specific consideration if adopted to
  handle health data collected through IoMT. More specifically, for health data, there
  are burgeoning open-source initiatives that focus on novel machine learning techniques
  for personal health data on the ``edge.'' There are also various commercial solutions
  in this space, but they all operate in silos, which may need to change to achieve
  greater connectivity and interoperability. The chapter surveys existing solutions
  for personal health data management, discuss their strengths, and provides critical
  analyses of the aspects lacking in these systems. The chapter will conclude with
  future directions that would ultimately culminate in better IoMT integrated architectures
  for personal health data collection, storage, and management in a secure and privacy-preserving
  manner.
