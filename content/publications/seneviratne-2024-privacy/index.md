abstract: Amidst the evolving landscape of mental health care, the imperative for
  non-intrusive, continuous data collection is juxtaposed with the concern for patient
  privacy and the inherent challenges of maintaining engagement. In this pro-posed
  work, we aim to address privacy challenges in mental health by combining decentralized,
  federated learning, privacy- preservation techniques, and explanation generation
  for per-sonalized insights using data from various sources, including smartphones
  and personal health devices.
