 abstract = {RDF is at the heart of the Semantic Web as it is the primary means by which applications can share data and interoper- ate. Tabulator is a generic data browser and editor for linked RDF data on the web. It was developed with the motiva- tion of providing a natural and a seamless experience for browsing and editing data (Tim Berners-Lee, 2008). This paper describes how Tabulator can be used to develop cus- tom applications which consume RDF data, in addition to providing a generic data browsing and editing environment. The goal is to make sure that the end-user has the ability to view the RDF data in a visualization that is most suitable given the nature of the data.},
