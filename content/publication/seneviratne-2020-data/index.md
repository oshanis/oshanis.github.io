abstract: Decentralized information-sharing mediums, such as the Web, have been designed
  to share information by merely creating a document on a web server and linking it
  from another document. As the Web has grown exponentially in its existence for over
  three decades, we have come to face many tough questions on the data and content
  shared on the Web. Some of these questions include how do we characterize data on
  the Web, who owns the data, how does ownership help decide anything? If we own data,
  how do we give consent for uncertain future analyses or activities? How can we use
  data for purposes beyond its intended use ethically and responsibly? Furthermore,
  what is the meaning of morally responsible data collection, usage, and sharing?
  As users can anonymously or pseudonymously engage in activities, the lack of an
  individual's identity on the Web is further complicated because consent on data
  usage changes in value, especially concerning confidentiality over time. While there
  are no simple answers to these challenging questions, there have been several technological
  advances to provide Web-based data provenance and accountability on the Web. This
  chapter reviews some of the underlying problems that give rise to data reuse and
  accountability issues on the Web, and features technical solutions with provenance
  by utilizing the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
